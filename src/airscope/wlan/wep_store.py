"""Passive WEP capture store (always-on, RX-only).

The single sink for everything we passively learn from WEP-encrypted Data
frames on the RX/parse path. One ``observe(bssid, parsed)`` call routes a frame to all the
right buckets:

  - unique 3-byte IVs (deduped) → the count that drives "ETA to 10k"
  - broadcast ARP-sized frames → replay seeds for the ARP-replay attack
  - those same frames' (IV, ciphertext) → PTW crack samples (known plaintext)

Keeping the routing here (not in WlanInterface) means callers never need to
know ARP sizes or cipher offsets. No TX, no association. It works equally
from the Scanner (channel hopping) and Focus (parked), the only difference
being how fast frames arrive.

The light, UI-facing counters live on ``AccessPoint.wep`` (a ``WepStats``);
the heavy buffers live here so the ``WepStats`` model stays cheap to poll.
