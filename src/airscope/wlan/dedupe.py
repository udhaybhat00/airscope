"""Merge N per-card 802.11 RX streams into one deduplicated stream.

Two (or more) monitor-mode radios tuned to the same air hear mostly the same frames. ``submit``
returns True the first time a given on-air transmission is seen and False for every cross-card copy
that lands within ``window`` seconds, so each transmission surfaces exactly once no matter how many
cards caught it. What one card's antenna misses another often catches, so the merged stream is
strictly richer than any single card.

The key is FCS- and driver-independent: frame-control + addr1/2/3 + seq_ctrl (the MPDU header,
bytes ``[0:2] + [4:24]``). The same transmission heard by two cards carries identical addresses and
sequence number, so it collapses to one. A retransmission flips the Retry bit inside frame-control
and a fresh frame steps seq_ctrl, so neither is wrongly merged. Keys live only for ``window``
seconds, so a much-later frame that reuses a sequence number is never suppressed.

Promoted from ``scripts/cross_streams.py`` and generalized from two fixed int-indexed sources to a
dynamic set of string-keyed sources (a card id per source), so cards can be added and dropped at
runtime (hotplug / unplug). ``scripts/cross_streams.py`` keeps its own two-source copy.

    one, which is the coverage a single card would have lost.
