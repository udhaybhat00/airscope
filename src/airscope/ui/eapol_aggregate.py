"""Deferred, per-client aggregation of EAPOL frames into one handshake tree.

The granular capture detector surfaces every EAPOL frame the instant it lands;
logged raw that's a wall of near-duplicate ``M1 …`` / ``M1 …`` / ``M3 …`` lines
during a deauth storm. This aggregator buffers a client's frames and emits one
tidy tree instead::

    4-Way Handshake · Client: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
     ├─► M1 ×20 (AP→Client) ANonce✓ PMKID✓
     ├─► M2     (AP←Client) SNonce✓ MIC✓ EAPOL✓
     └─► ✓ Valid 4-Way Handshake (M1+M2)

Flush policy (chosen with the user):

* **First crackable pair → flush immediately.** The win shows the instant the
  handshake is crackable, usually at M2, *before* M4; we don't even keep M4.
* **Then suppress that client until a new ANonce instance completes.** The
  detector fires one HANDSHAKE event per instance, so retransmitted M3/M4 of the
  captured exchange are swallowed; a genuine re-handshake re-announces (``×2``).
* **Partial bursts** (frames that never complete) flush after ``settle_s`` of
  quiet with no verdict leaf, so a client spamming M1 is still surfaced once.

Pure + clock-injected (``now`` is passed in), so it unit-tests with no UI / no
hardware. Side effects (saving the .pcap) stay in the screen.
