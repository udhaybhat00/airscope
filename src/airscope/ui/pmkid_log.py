"""Rich-markup rendering for the active PMKID harvest, as a 4-way-handshake-style tree.

Built from per-line fragments (a ``PMKID · Harvesting from <essid>`` header, the
auth/assoc/M1 action branches, and the terminal verdict) so the SAME builders
serve two emit modes: composed into one list for an atomic dump today, and called
one-at-a-time on live progress events once the harvest becomes a campaign. Pure +
UI-free (testable without a terminal); the screen owns side effects (save, log).

Field ticks (``PMKID✓/✗``) reuse the 4-way handshake's glyphs; the heavy ``╳``
is reserved for the terminal give-up connector (``treelog.leaf_fail``).
