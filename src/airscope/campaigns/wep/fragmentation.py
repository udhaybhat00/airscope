"""WEP fragmentation attack (`aireplay-ng -5`): M5.

.. warning::
    **NOT WIRED INTO THE PRODUCT: reference implementation.** Fragmentation needs every
    fragment of an MSDU to share one 802.11 sequence number, i.e. a per-driver software-sequence
    TX path (``en_hwseq=0`` + a ``SUPPORTS_SW_SEQ`` flag) that no longer exists. As-is this WILL
    NOT RUN: ``_inject_round`` passes ``send_raw(..., sw_seq=...)``, a removed parameter. Re-wiring
    means first restoring shared sequence-ID support in the TX framework (see ``docs/porting/METHODOLOGY.md``).
    ARP-replay + ChopChop carry WEP without it.

Manufactures a replayable ARP when there's none to capture: the whole reason
`-5` exists. Seed 8 bytes of keystream from ANY captured WEP *data* frame via
its fixed LLC/SNAP prefix (NOT a broadcast ARP, depending on one would be
circular: ARP replay would already have that seed), then fragment a
known-plaintext broadcast ARP into ≤16 tiny frames encrypted under that seed.
The AP reassembles them, re-encrypts under a fresh IV, and rebroadcasts the
result, which is itself a replayable ARP seed. So one ordinary client data
packet (a TCP segment you can't replay) becomes a forged ARP you can.

HARDWARE-VERIFIED end-to-end (dd-wrt, rtl8821au): a decrypted relay matched our
forged ARP byte-for-byte. The crypto is in dot11/wep/crypto.py
(`seed_keystream_from_arp`, `build_fragments`); this daemon wires the send loop
+ the live-AP relay watch around it.

RELAY SIGNATURE (pinned from the probe pcap): the AP's relay of our reassembled ARP is a
Data frame, FromDS + Protected, Addr1(DA)=broadcast, **Addr3(SA)=our forged STA
MAC**, with a FRESH IV (≠ our seed's), ~68 B. The AP rebroadcasts onto every
BSS it runs, so we match on SA==our_mac, NOT on a specific BSSID.

State machine (locked design, README "M5/M6: refined"): user-driven, NOT
auto-escalating. The ONE auto-transition is on SUCCESS (unambiguous): the moment
a relay with our SA appears, we hand it to the campaign (`on_forged_arp`) and
stop: immediate handoff, because ARP replay mints IVs far faster than
fragmentation does, and that relay is already a store-logged seed. A round that
elicits no relay is NOT failure (could be range / TX glitch / a momentarily busy
AP). We KEEP RETRYING and log a running tally so the *user* decides when to
switch; we never auto-stop. The campaign pauses ARP replay before starting us
(one TX activity on the half-duplex radio) and resumes it on our success.
