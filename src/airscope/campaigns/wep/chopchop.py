"""WEP ChopChop attack (`aireplay-ng -4`): M6.

Decrypts a captured frame byte-by-byte using the AP's ICV check, no key:
chop the last byte, guess its plaintext (≤256), fix the ICV
(dot11.wep.crypto.chop_last_byte_and_fixup, CRC32 is linear), re-header to a data
frame from us, send. The AP relays the shortened frame IFF the guess was right.
Walk backwards recovering one keystream byte per accepted guess → enough
keystream to forge a broadcast ARP → hand to replay.

IDENTITY-BY-CONSTRUCTION (ported from aireplay-ng's do_attack_chopchop, the
ground truth): we do NOT infer which guess the AP accepted from "which frame we
sent" or "which relay came first". That inference is what made sibling-BSS
echoes and multi-relay APs ambiguous. Instead, like aireplay, we **stamp the
guess value into the destination MAC** of every candidate (DA =
``FF:rr:rr:rr:rr:GUESS``, with a sentinel bit in byte 1), blast all 256 guesses
in a rolling stream, and **read the accepted guess straight back out of the
AP's relayed frame** (``guess = relay Addr1[5]``). The relay carries its own
identity, so guess order is irrelevant, duplicate echoes resolve to the same
byte, and a multi-relay AP can't confuse us. No DFS, no "first is truth."

The sentinel (guess 256) is a deliberately bad-ICV frame: if the AP relays it,
the AP doesn't discard invalid-ICV frames and chopchop can't work: we say so
rather than failing silently (aireplay-ng.c, the ``h80211[5] & 1`` check).

Keystream recovery (the offline-testable core): the keystream is fixed per IV,
so each accepted guess gives ks[i] = body[i] XOR guess, recovered end-inward. We
chop to the AP's drop-short wall, then reconstruct the hidden head from known
structure, confirmed offline against the captured frame's OWN ICV, no AP round-
trip (aireplay-ng's header_rec):
  - ARP: LLC/SNAP + ARP-request header is known through byte 15. A wall one byte
    into the (unknown) sender MAC has that single byte recovered from the AP.
  - IP (any broadcast IP datagram): LLC/SNAP + IP version/IHL + TOS + total-
    length cover bytes 0..11: version/IHL and TOS are brute-forced (16×256),
    total-length is computed from the frame size, all confirmed by the CRC. This
    needs the AP to relay down to a <=12-byte cipher; a deeper wall hides
    genuinely-unknown IP fields (id / flags / TTL / …) we can't derive.
Either way the output is a forged broadcast ARP (we only need ~40 keystream
bytes for the IV) handed to replay, the seed type only changes how the head is
recovered.

Lifecycle mirrors WepFragmentation (start/stop/state, on_forged_arp, keep-
retrying). The campaign pauses replay before running this and resumes it on
success with the forged ARP.
