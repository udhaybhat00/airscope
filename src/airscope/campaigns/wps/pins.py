"""WPS PIN keyspace: the two-halves search with checksum.

An 8-digit WPS PIN is P1 (first 4 digits) + P2 (last 4 = 3 free digits + a
checksum over the first 7). The AP judges each half separately, letting us recover them
independently: 10⁴ first-half guesses, then 10³ second-half guesses (the 8th
digit is derived), ≈ 11,000 worst case instead of 10⁸.

During the first-half sweep the second half is irrelevant to the M4 R-Hash1
check, so we pad it with a fixed valid tail. Once the first half is confirmed
(the AP returns M5), the second-half sweep walks the 1000 valid tails.
