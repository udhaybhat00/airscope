# rt2800usb family

Ralink rt2800usb-family port from the kernel `rt2x00` source (`driver_sources/rt2x00-source-v6.18/`),
verified on hardware. One driver claims three VID:PIDs (`148f:5372/3572/5572`) and dispatches per
the `silicon_id` read from MAC_CSR0 at connect. The USB PID is named after the marketing SKU, but
the on-chip MAC_CSR0 reports the actual silicon ID — and the two diverge on all three rebrands:
RT5372→0x5392, RT3572→0x3572, RT5572→0x5592.

## Status

Cold bring-up, RX, and TX inject are working on hardware across all three silicons (M1-M5).
The RT5392 (PAU05) is the reference unit — its full attack chain works end-to-end (deauth → EAPOL
re-capture, WEP ARP replay + chop/frag). Warm reattach is detected but not yet taken — the driver
always cold-restarts. EEPROM-aware RSSI, per-channel TX power (RT5392), and a 93C66 EEPROM fallback
for pre-EFUSE RT2870 dongles are deferred polish.

The AWUS051NH v2 (RT3572) test unit has a **partially-burned EFUSE** (NIC_CONF0/RF-cal erased, but
RSSI/TXMIXER/BYRATE regions populated) and can't be cleanly verified — see Gotchas. Its 2.4-GHz TX
(inject/deauth) was dead until the TXMIXER_GAIN fix (see the residuals section); 5 GHz TX + 2.4/5 GHz
RX already worked. A properly-burned RT3572 is still needed to confirm that family's attack stack.

## Gotchas

**The vendor-request signature lies.** Kernel `rt2x00usb_vendor_request` is declared
`(u16 offset, u16 value)` but the wire goes `(value=wValue, offset=wIndex)`. Any other ordering
returns `0x00020208` (a stale word) for every address. Register access uses `bRequest` 6/7
(multi) or 2/3 (single), `wValue=0`, `wIndex=addr`.

**Multi-byte transfers must chunk to 64 bytes** (kernel `CSR_CACHE_SIZE`). A single 4-KB FW upload
silently fails or pipe-stalls; chunking to 64×64 (address advancing 64 bytes per chunk) fixes it.

**EFUSE `freq_offset` is the actual RX gate.** Without it the chip tunes a fraction of a MHz
off-channel, the BBP never locks onto preambles, and bulk-IN goes silent with every diagnostic
register reading correctly — this cost multiple hours. `EFUSE_CTRL.ADDRESS_IN` is a **u16-word**
index (`byte_offset // 2`), easy to get wrong as a byte address. The real EFUSE MAC is also needed
in MAC_ADDR_DW0/DW1 for the RX matching engine (a fake MAC + `UNICAST_TO_ME_MASK=0xFF` was an
earlier workaround).

**RX L2 padding must be removed before trimming to MPDU length.** The hw inserts 2 bytes between
header and payload when the header isn't 4-aligned (every QoS-Data frame, i.e. the EAPOL carrier;
beacons aren't padded). Trimming to `MPDU_TOTAL_BYTE_COUNT` first clips the last 2 body bytes — an
EAPOL M2's key_data tail — surfacing as "EAPOL clipped" + an uncrackable handshake.

**The TX crypto engine must be disarmed or WEP injects die silently.** `reg_init` clears
SHARED_KEY_MODE / WCID / WCID_ATTR / IVEIV so the zeroed TXWI W2/W3 (IV/EIV) are safe. If any
cipher table is left set, the engine encrypts a Protected inject and overwrites the frame's real IV
with zeros — the AP's ICV check drops every replay while TX_STA_FIFO still flags TX_SUCCESS.

**TX inject needs three things the RX path doesn't.** A mandatory 4-byte USB *end* pad after the
alignment pad (kernel `roundup(len,4)+4`; without it the chip never ACKs the bulk-OUT); `QSEL=2`
(EDCA), not MGMT, for every frame including management; and bulk-OUT EP `0x02` (AC_BE), not `0x06`
— the MGMT endpoint is chip→host TX status, not host→chip submission.

**RT3572 with an erased EFUSE behaves non-obviously, and it's hardware, not the driver.** Identity
is programmed but the RF/cal region reads 0xFF and `NIC_CONF0=0x0000`. The kernel runs the unit as
**1T1R** (RFCSR1=0xf1, chains 1+2 powered down), and the rx-filter calibration loop has no real
loopback response so it **rails** (kernel high to 0x6b, our driver low to 0x07) — both rails are
non-physical, neither is a calibration, and the ~7-count offset is noise on a degenerate filter,
not a portable bug. The weak TX (~20-40 deauths on-air, high variance) is the missing factory cal.
RFCSR12/13.TX_POWER is a **backoff code** (higher = more attenuation = weaker); the unburned
fallback is the low value (power1=11, power2=0), not a near-max guess. An unburned EFUSE on a retail
card is itself suspect (QC miss or counterfeit).

**Settle timing is a non-issue on userland USB.** Kernel `msleep(1)` delays port to a Windows
no-op (~15.6 ms tick), but every register access is already a ~1 ms+ USB round-trip, so inter-op
latency covers the kernel's millisecond settles. Real busy-waits changed cal readings by exactly
zero — don't chase settle timing as a cause of RF misbehaviour.

**RT5592 auto-manages some RFCSRs** — readback after init doesn't always match what we wrote; this
is expected (see `feedback_rt5592_chip_auto_managed_rfcsr`). It also picks one of two channel
tables (xtal20/xtal40) at runtime from `MAC_DEBUG_INDEX.XTAL` because the PCB can ship either
crystal, and runs a per-tune IQ calibration (BBP158/159 indirect pairs) on every channel set.

**Focus-entry channel tune sometimes doesn't take the first time** (0 beacons; re-entering Focus
fixes it). Reproduced on the MT7610U too, so it's a bug in the **shared Focus→set_channel path**,
not RT3572-specific.

## Orientation

RT5392 is 1T1R 2.4 GHz; RT3572/RT5592 are 2.4 + 5 GHz, 2T2R-capable. Single 4096-byte FW blob
(`assets/rt5572.bin`) shared across the family — trailing 2 bytes are CRC-CCITT (LSB-first,
reversed poly 0x8408), matching the Linux `crc_ccitt` lib (not the MSB-first XModem variant).

Start at `driver.connect` for the cold flow: chip-id → FW upload → EFUSE read → MAC/BBP/RFCSR init
→ enable_radio → channel tune → RX loop. EFUSE is `eeprom.py`; per-silicon channel synth is
`chan.set_channel` (RF53xx/RF3052 use a 3-field synth, RF5592 a 5-field one); RX/TX descriptor
decode/build is `rx.parse_rx_urb` / `tx.py`. Names match the kernel C — grep the source bundle to
cross-reference.

The RxReaderThread + ToDS-promiscuous-filter (`RX_FILTER_CFG=0x11`, DROP_NOT_TO_ME clear) and the
ported RX-AGC link tuner (`link_tuner.py` + `driver._link_tuner_loop`) are monitor-mode deviations
from the kernel STA path — captured below.

## EEPROM variants (RF-chip / antenna)

Ralink cards have no Realtek-style `rfe_type`. The rt2800 family separates **two**
ids: the **RT MAC silicon** (read from `MAC_CSR0`; drives `rt2800_init_bbp` /
`rt2800_init_rfcsr`, both switched on `chip.rt`) and the **RF companion chip**
(EEPROM-encoded; drives `rt2800_config_channel`, switched on `chip.rf`). Same
silicon can pair with different RF chips, so the **RF chip is the real
config_channel discriminator** — see `eeprom.resolve_rf_chip` (a 1:1 port of the
RF-id block of `rt2800_init_eeprom`, [SRC] rt2800lib.c:11182-11235):

| RT silicon (`MAC_CSR0`)     | RF-id source        | `config_channel` path |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| RT2860/2872, RT3070/3071/3090/3390, **RT3572** | `NIC_CONF0.RF_TYPE` (bits[11:8]) | RF3020/21/22/3320→rf3xxx · **RF3052→rf3052** · RF3070→rf53xx |
| RT5390/RT5392/RT3290/RT6352 | `EEPROM_CHIP_ID` (word 0) | RF5370/72/90/92→rf53xx |
| RT3352→RF3322, RT3883→RF3853, RT5350→RF5350, RT5592→RF5592 | hardcoded per silicon | rf3322 / rf3853 / rf53xx / rf55xx |

**For sibling ports this is the key trap:** the RF chip is NOT derivable from the
silicon alone. RT3070 silicon can be RF3020/3021/3022 (→ rf3xxx) **or** RF3070 (→
rf53xx) — different `config_channel` functions selected by `NIC_CONF0.RF_TYPE`.
RT5370/RT5372 share silicon but differ in `EEPROM_CHIP_ID`. A sibling that
hardcodes one RF per silicon will mis-tune the others.

**This driver (RT3572) is a 1:1 silicon↔RF case** — RT3572 always pairs with
RF3052, so the port's silicon-keyed tune dispatch (`chan.set_channel(silicon_id)`)
is byte-equivalent to the kernel's RF-keyed dispatch. `resolve_rf_chip` is now
read + logged at connect (the one-line `detected config:` line) and guards an
unexpected/unported RF with an `untested variant:` warning rather than failing —
the kernel `-ENODEV`s an unknown RF, we give it a shot (a retail RT3572 with an
**unburned** EEPROM reads `RF_TYPE=0`, which the kernel would reject).

**Antenna is already runtime-gated, no hardcode to fix.** `NIC_CONF0.TXPATH/RXPATH`
flow through `eeprom.txpath/rxpath` → `chan.set_channel` (RFCSR1 chain power-downs,
TX_PIN_CFG PA/LNA enables) and `bbp.disable_unused_dac_adc` (raw fields). A burned
2T2R RT3572 and the tested unburned-→-1T1R AWUS051NH v2 both take the correct
branch; `ANT_DIVERSITY` (NIC_CONF1) is RT3070/3090/3352/3390-only, so RT3572
always uses `ANTENNA_A` (no diversity branch).

**TXMIXER_GAIN — was the 2.4-GHz-TX-dead bug (FIXED, pending live test):**
`txmixer_gain_24g`/`_5g` (`EEPROM_TXMIXER_GAIN_BG`=word 0x24 / `_A`=word 0x26,
bits[2:0], [SRC] rt2800lib.c:10996/11011) were pinned to 0. They gate the
`RFCSR16.TXMIXER_GAIN` write in `config_channel_rf3052`. The AWUS051NH v2's
NIC_CONF0 is unburned (0x0000) but these two mixer-gain words are **burned**
(word 0x24=0x0004 → 24g gain 4, word 0x26=0x0002 → 5g gain 2 — confirmed from
`captures_rt3572_tx_diff/aireplay.pcap`, EFUSE block words 32-39). Pinning to 0
wrote **RFCSR16=0x48 on 2.4 GHz where the in-tree driver writes 0x4c** — zeroing
the 2.4-GHz TX mixer gain, which is what killed CCK (2.4 GHz) inject/deauth. 5 GHz
uses base 0x7a and OFDM, so its smaller gain (2) mismatch (0x78 vs kernel 0x7a) was
survivable → 5 GHz TX worked, 2.4 didn't. Now `EepromValues.txmixer_gain_bg/_a`
port `rt2800_get_txmixer_gain_{24g,5g}` (word, low-byte-0xff→0 fallback) and feed
`_channel_kwargs` → RFCSR16 matches the kernel wire on both bands. RF5592 is
unaffected (its RF55xx tune has no RFCSR16 TXMIXER write); verify_pcap stays
39408/39408.

**Not the bug — `_RT3572_TX_PWR_CFG_DEFAULTS` is already byte-exact.** The
per-rate `TX_PWR_CFG_0..4` hardcode reproduces `aireplay.pcap` exactly
(0xccccaaaa / 0xccccaacc×4 — verified on the wire), so it is NOT why 2.4 TX
failed. A differently-burned RT3572 would still want these derived from
`EEPROM_TXPOWER_BYRATE` via `rt2800_config_txpower_rt28xx` (incl. the
RT3070/71/90/**3572** gain-cal delta the RF5592 `config_txpower` path skips);
left as-is because it is byte-correct for the reference card and rewriting it
risks regressing that match. RX is unaffected either way.

## Scripts

- `test_hw_rt2800usb.py --phase {open,fw,usbinit,macinit,bbpinit,rfinit,rx}` — staged HW bring-up.
- `rt2800_ctrl_diff.py` — extracts the kernel control-transfer sequence from a pcap; isolated the missing EFUSE walk.
- `verify_pcap.py` — single-cursor whole-capture byte gate, fail-closed, 0 waivers, exit 0.
  Drives the port's real helpers in kernel wire order over one cursor and now reproduces the
  RT5572 capture **end to end: 39408/39408 control ops (100%)** — cold bring-up → airmon
  monitor-enable → the 128-hop channel stream → the aireplay-ng TX-injection region
  (TX_STA_FIFO drain). Plus `[tx inject]` rebuilds all **753 bulk-OUT TX frames byte-for-byte**
  (CCK 2.4 GHz + OFDM 5 GHz) via `tx.build_tx_descriptors`, and `[channel tune]` re-verifies
  128/128 tunes as an independent cross-check. The hop stream runs a STRICT per-hop bracket
  with per-step opener checks; the only event allowed to interleave out of order is the async
  `configure_filter` reapply (proven async: 4 reapplies vs 126 hops).

## Debug log

### RT3572 2.4-GHz TX still weak after RFCSR16 fix — it is the unburned cal, not a missing register (2026-07-11)

Follow-up to the RFCSR16 fix below: 2.4-GHz inject still under-performed on the
AWUS051NH v2 even with `txmixer=(4,2)` / RFCSR16=0x4c confirmed live. Re-diffed the
port's `_set_channel_3572(channel=1)` output against the in-tree driver's
`captures_rt3572_tx_diff/aireplay.pcap` (same card) at the **decoded RFCSR/BBP/reg
level** (decode both indirect writes, not just raw `RF_CSR_CFG`/`BBP_CSR_CFG` words).
Result: **every TX-enable register now matches the kernel byte-for-byte** — RFCSR1
chain-PD (0xf1), RFCSR12/13 TX_POWER (0x6b/0x60), RFCSR16 TXMIXER (0x4c), TX_PIN_CFG
PA/LNA (0x00050302), TX_BAND_CFG (0x04), TX_PWR_CFG_0..4 (0xccccaaaa/0xccccaacc), BBP1.
The **only** remaining code divergence was RX-side: kernel wrote BBP82=0x62 (×2) +
BBP75=0x46, we wrote BBP82=0x84 + BBP75=0x50 — the `has_cap_external_lna_bg` branch
[SRC rt2800lib.c:4312-4322]. The RF3052 tune ignored NIC_CONF1.EXTERNAL_LNA_2G
(hardcoded the internal-LNA else-branch). This card has an external 2.4-GHz LNA
(NIC_CONF1 bit 2 burned), so the kernel takes the external branch on every 2.4-GHz
tune. Fixed: thread `has_cap_external_lna_bg` through `_channel_kwargs` →
`set_channel` → `_set_channel_3572` (5 GHz already honored `external_lna_a`). This is
BBP RX-AGC, not a TX enable, so it aligns the 2.4-GHz tune to full byte-parity and may
improve 2.4 RX/ACK-hearing on this external-LNA card, but is **not** expected to make
2.4 TX strong.

Honest conclusion: there is **no missing 2.4-GHz TX-enable register**. The in-tree
driver on this same card only achieves *weak/partial* 2.4-GHz deauth (aireplay.log:
partial ACK counts, e.g. `[16| 8 ACKs]` of 64 — not zero, not strong), which is the
signature of the missing factory power/RF cal, not a code gap. A **burned EFUSE**
would supply the real per-channel TX power (TXPOWER_BG1/BG2 → RFCSR12/13), per-rate
power (TXPOWER_BYRATE → TX_PWR_CFG, vs our wire-derived 0xccccaaaa hardcode), and a
real RX-filter cal (RFCSR24/31, vs the railed 0x6b) — collectively strong 2.4 TX.
Needs a properly-burned RT3572 to confirm. RF5592 verify_pcap unaffected (39408/39408,
0 waived, exit 0).

### RT3572 2.4-GHz TX dead: RFCSR16 TXMIXER_GAIN pinned to 0 (2026-07-11)

Symptom: on the AWUS051NH v2, 5 GHz TX + 2.4/5 GHz RX worked, but 2.4 GHz
inject/deauth was dead (live-confirmed). Diffed our `config_channel_rf3052`
2.4-GHz output against the in-tree driver's `captures_rt3572_tx_diff/aireplay.pcap`
(same card): every register matched **except RFCSR16 — kernel writes 0x4c, we
wrote 0x48**. RFCSR16 base is 0x4c with `TXMIXER_GAIN` in bits[2:0]; the kernel
sources that field from `rt2800_get_txmixer_gain_24g` (EEPROM word 0x24). We pinned
`txmixer_gain_24g=0`, clearing bits[2:0] (0x4c→0x48) and zeroing the 2.4-GHz TX
mixer gain → CCK/2.4 TX emits ~nothing. Reconstructed EFUSE word 0x24 from the
pcap's EFUSE block (words 32-39) = **0x0004** → gain 4 → 0x4c: the mixer region is
burned even though NIC_CONF0 is 0x0000. 5 GHz uses base 0x7a + OFDM and word 0x26
= 0x0002 (gain 2), a smaller mismatch (0x78 vs 0x7a) that stayed on-air — hence the
2.4-only failure. Fix: `EepromValues.txmixer_gain_bg/_a` port
`rt2800_get_txmixer_gain_{24g,5g}` (word 0x24/0x26, low-byte-0xff→0), threaded into
`_channel_kwargs`. The `_RT3572_TX_PWR_CFG_DEFAULTS` were a red herring — the wire
shows them byte-exact (0xccccaaaa / 0xccccaacc). Needs a live 2.4-GHz deauth to
confirm on-air; RF5592 verify_pcap unaffected (39408/39408).

### EFUSE: the RX blocker

M3 (RX) delivered no bulk-IN URBs until EFUSE bring-up landed — clean bring-up, every diagnostic
register correct, bulk-IN silent. `rt2800_ctrl_diff.py` over the rt5372 capture showed the first
~250 vendor requests are all EFUSE reads (32 iterations hitting `EFUSE_CTRL=0x0580`); airscope was
doing zero. The gate was `freq_offset` (crystal oscillator offset) — without it the BBP never locks
a preamble. `ADDRESS_IN` being a u16-word index (`byte_offset // 2`) was the subtle fix; a later
audit confirmed it byte-for-byte vs the kernel walk and showed no RX regression on real cards.

### TX inject: three follow-on bugs

Once RX worked, `iface.deauth` hit errno 10060 (timeout) on bulk-OUT. Reading
`rt2800usb_get_tx_data_len` + `rt2800usb_write_tx_desc` turned up the mandatory +4 USB end pad,
`QSEL=2` (not MGMT), and bulk-OUT EP 0x02 (not 0x06). With all three, deauth against a real AP
deauths a phone → reconnect → captures the new 4-way handshake.

### WEP IV zeroing

WEP ARP replay was dead on the RT5572 — a dual-NIC sniff showed on-air IV=00:00:00 and zero AP
rebroadcasts — until the SHARED_KEY_MODE clear in `reg_init` landed. The left-armed crypto engine
was overwriting the real IV with the zeroed TXWI W2/W3. With it, ~4000 AP rebroadcasts per 30 s and
chop/frag work.

### RX-AGC link tuner (weak/unstable RX)

On PAU05 the beacon rate wandered (1-3/s → 7-8/s → 4-5/s) with periodic ~zero gaps every ~10-15 s,
and a strong *near* AP came in worse than a weak *far* one — the signature of front-end overload,
not a detune. BBP66 (RX VGC/AGC gain) was seeded once per channel tune and never adapted, so we sat
permanently at the most-sensitive seed. Ported the kernel's ~1 Hz link tuner (`link_tuner.py`),
which *raises* VGC when averaged RSSI is strong. Monitor-mode deviation: kernel disables the tuner
for a pure-monitor interface and feeds it from associated-BSS beacons only; we keep the algorithm
verbatim but source RSSI from every good frame, and it can only de-sensitise on strong signals so
weak-signal sensitivity is never reduced. Resets on every channel change. HW (PAU09/RT5572,
2026-07-06): strong-AP beacon rate is stable at kernel parity (9.1 vs 9.6/s) — the tuner does its
stability job — but 2.4 breadth trails kernel (87 vs 111 APs); suspected the RSSI over-read
(EFUSE-aware RSSI, below) drives the de-sensitisation.

### RT3572 unburned-EFUSE attack pass (2026-05-31)

A full attack pass on the erased-EFUSE AWUS051NH v2 produced exactly the weak-TX/RX signature the
missing factory cal predicts: scan weak (~8 beacons/s from a few feet, ~10/s healthy), deauth too
weak to knock a phone beside the radio, partial handshake (M1+M4), passive PMKID only, WEP ARP
replay works but ChopChop stalls, WPS unreliable. All consistent with the missing RF cal — not new
bugs. We briefly tried forcing the kernel's railed-high 0x6b and sweeping mid-range cal values; the
on-air metric is dominated by RF environment so nothing beat the kernel's loop reliably (reverted).
These need a properly-burned RT3572 to verify.

The `rt2800_disable_unused_dac_adc` gate reads the **raw** NIC_CONF0 TXPATH/RXPATH fields, not a
validated chain count — on the erased EFUSE both read 0 so the kernel powers down neither DAC1 nor
ADC1; `driver.py` passes the raw fields through so DAC1 stays up without forcing a phantom chain.
An earlier "force 2T2R" override was a workaround for our own DAC-gate bug and diverged from the
wire — removed.

### EFUSE-aware RSSI (deferred)

RSSI is `base_val(-12) - eeprom_offset - lna_gain - raw_byte`, max across paths. We currently use
`eeprom_offset = lna_gain = 0`; `lna_gain` and `rssi_bg_offset0/1` are now read from EFUSE but rx.py
still uses the simplified form. Wire the EFUSE values in when EEPROM-aware RSSI lands (shares work
with the per-channel TX power tables).

HW-confirmed (2026-07-06, PAU09 vs kernel): the simplified form over-reads RSSI by **+8.1 dB (2.4)**
/ **+10.7 dB (5 GHz)** — band-split, as the missing per-band `lna_gain`/`rssi_bg_offset` predicts.
Not just cosmetic: the over-read feeds the RX-AGC link tuner (above), which de-sensitises on strong
averaged RSSI, so marginal 2.4 APs drop (breadth 87 vs kernel 111). Wiring the EFUSE values into
`rx.py` is the lead for closing that breadth gap.

### Byte-for-byte convergence to the kernel (2026-07-08)

Rebuilt `verify_pcap` from anchored blocks into a single-cursor whole-capture walk (RT5572/RF5592,
`driver_captures/captures_rt2800usb_rt5572_2`) and converged the port to emit the kernel's exact bytes.
Cold bring-up now walks **1781 ops byte-for-byte** + **128/128 channel-tune blocks** (80.3% of the
capture, 0 waivers). Operational phase (airmon monitor-enable + `iw`/airodump hops) still pending.
RX + PA hardware-verified after each behavioural change (PAU09, cold: RFCSR49/50 = 17/15, ~900
beacons/hop). What changed, per commit:

- **`9ed7e1a` TX power + cascade.** `chan.default_power` decodes RFCSR49/50 from EEPROM
  TXPOWER_BG1/BG2 (2.4 GHz) / A1/A2 (5 GHz, per-silicon index) with `txpower_to_dev` clamp; added
  `config_txpower` (TX_PWR_CFG_0..4 from TXPOWER_BYRATE) to the RF55xx tune. Fixes: `freq_cal_mode1_usb`
  RFCSR17-already-set short-circuit; NIC_CONF1 capability masks (BT/ext-LNA-BG/A were bits 13/8/9 →
  14/2/3); `iq_calibrate` 0xFF→0 only on the 2 global comp/imbal bytes (per-band TX0/TX1 raw);
  `AUTOWAKEUP_CFG` `0x1010`→`0x1208`; added `autorun_detect` (EFUSE + FW paths) + `probe_hw_gpio`.
  Unburned EFUSE keeps the wire-derived fallback.
- **`39809cb` verify_pcap walk.** Replaced anchored EFUSE/FW blocks with `verify_cold_walk` (one
  cursor, kernel order) + explicit coverage reporting.
- **`749e913` radio-on.** Added `set_radio_led` (MCU_LED from EEPROM_FREQ LED_MODE) + MCU_WAKEUP;
  MCU_LED / MCU_WAKEUP constants.
- **`169014c` USB DMA.** `USB_DMA_CFG.RX_BULK_AGG_LIMIT` was omitted (`0xc00080`→`0xc02d80`); split
  `usb_enable_radio_dma` out of the monolithic `enable_radio`.
- **`0cacfcd` init_registers.** Nest `usb_init_registers` (drv-hook reset) inside `init_registers`
  (dropped the duplicate `connect()` call); port `config_filter(FIF_ALLMULTI)` (`RX_FILTER_CFG`=0x1bf97);
  RTS threshold 2347→**2353** (Linux `IEEE80211_MAX_RTS_THRESHOLD`); WCID entry as one 8-byte
  multiwrite (was 2× `write32`); port the 8 beacon-slot clears.
- **`ddda352` init_bbp/rfcsr.** Port the BBP138 RX_ADC1/TX_DAC1 RMW in `normal_mode_setup_5xxx`
  (threaded txpath/rxpath through `init_rfcsr`). init_bbp needed no change.
- **`8d9f1dc` enable_radio tail.** Extracted `enable_radio_finish`: MAC_SYS_CTRL / WPDMA_GLO_CFG
  enables are now RMW (were direct writes) + LED_AG/ACT/POLARITY MCU configs (were skipped). The
  monitor `RX_FILTER_CFG`=0x11 stays in `connect()`'s `enable_radio` (kernel applies it in the
  operational phase, not here — to reconcile).

### Operational phase + TX inject: 100% byte-for-byte (2026-07-09)

Converged the rest of the RT5572 capture into the single cursor: **39408/39408 control ops
byte-for-byte (100%), 0 waivers, exit 0** — cold bring-up → airmon monitor-enable → the
128-hop channel stream → the aireplay-ng TX-injection region. Also added a `[tx inject]` gate
that rebuilds all **753 bulk-OUT TX frames byte-for-byte** (502 CCK 2.4 GHz + 251 OFDM 5 GHz).
The port's TX wire format matches the kernel for every injected frame including the OFDM/5 GHz
path — so the earlier "5 GHz TX broken" was the config_channel/txpower surface (converged in the
2026-07-08 work), not the TX descriptor. New walk-only ports: `mac.toggle_rx` / `config_retry_limit`
/ `config_ps_awake` / `update_survey` and `chan.config_ant`; `tx.build_tx_descriptors` gained
PACKETID + USB-burst params (defaults unchanged, so the live single-frame inject is byte-identical).

- **Monitor-enable filter dance.** mac80211 passes `FIF_ALLMULTI|FIF_CONTROL|FIF_PSPOLL` →
  `RX_FILTER_CFG`=0x97, then 0x93 once `CONFIG_MONITORING` is set. The walk reproduces both via the
  real `config_filter`; the periodic reapplies (12 across the capture) are **async** — proven, not
  assumed: 4 in the hop phase vs 126 hops, firing 2–396 frames after an RX re-enable. So the hop
  stream is driven as a strict fixed-order bracket with per-step opener checks, and only the
  `configure_filter` reapply may interleave (still byte-checked); any other out-of-order op halts
  the walk (verified: reordering the bracket collapses coverage 37435→2078 ops).
- **The `0x11` live monitor filter is a deliberate deviation, not yet reconciled.** `connect()`
  still writes `RX_FILTER_CFG`=0x11 in `enable_radio`'s tail — a monitor-first shortcut that skips
  the kernel's STA-mode-then-airmon `0x97→0x93` transition (0x11 is a superset-accepting filter:
  DROP_CRC|DROP_VER only). It is HW-validated and left as-is; the walk reproduces the kernel's
  operational filter dance separately. The operational helpers above are exercised **only by the
  walk** — the live channel-hop path (`driver.set_channel`) does its own simplified hop, so the
  walk proves the helpers are byte-correct but not that the live driver issues them in this order.
- **TX-status drain.** The injection region is dominated by 1399 `TX_STA_FIFO` read-to-pop polls
  (the kernel reaping each inject's completion). airscope fires TX without this drain loop; the walk
  reproduces the reads for cursor continuity so it can reach the 2 interleaved hops (127, 128).
