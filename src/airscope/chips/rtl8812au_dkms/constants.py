"""RTL8812AU (DKMS/PHYDM) chip-specific constants.

Only the values that DIFFER from the shared 88xxA family base
(``chips/rtl88xxau_base/registers.py``) live here: the USB PID, the TX page boundary
(computed differently than the 8821's), and the EEPROM logical-map offsets that the
2T2R 8812a places differently. Everything else (MAC/FW/EFUSE register addresses, bits)
is imported from the base. [SRC] cites are vendor `file:line`.
