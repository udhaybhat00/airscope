"""Runtime device state threaded from init into the operational phase.

The kernel keeps this in ``struct rt2800_drv_data`` (calibration_bw20/40, bbp25/26)
and on ``struct rt2x00_dev`` (lna_gain, curr_band). We carry the init-derived
calibration here so channel tuning can consume it [SRC rt2800lib.c
rt2800_rx_filter_calibration → drv_data->calibration_bw20].

``lna_gain`` is recomputed from the EEPROM on every config (``config_lna_gain``),
so it lives on the per-config call, not here.
