"""Periodic RX-AGC adaptation — the rt2x00 "link tuner" (BBP66 / VGC).

The rt2800 receiver's analog gain is governed by BBP register 66 (the
"VGC level"). The channel-tune path seeds it once to the most-sensitive
default; the kernel then runs a ~1 Hz tuner that re-seeds it from a
running average of received-frame RSSI. Without that loop the gain is
frozen at the seed: fine for weak/distant signals, but a strong nearby
AP overloads the front-end (AGC saturation / false-CCA bursts) and
beacons get dropped — a strong near AP comes in *worse* than a weak far
one. This module is that missing loop.

MONITOR-MODE DEVIATION: the kernel only runs this in STA mode and feeds
the EWMA from beacons of the *associated* BSS (rt2x00link.c:191,205 gate
on intf_sta_count + RXDONE_MY_BSS), and explicitly skips the tuner for a
pure-monitor interface (rt2x00link.c:228). Airscope is always-monitor, so
there is no associated BSS — we feed the EWMA from *every* successfully
received frame's RSSI instead. The algorithm (default-VGC + RSSI-gated
delta) is ported verbatim; only the RSSI source differs. The adjustment
is conservative: it can only *raise* VGC (de-sensitise) when the average
signal is strong, and falls back to the most-sensitive default whenever
no frame arrived in the last interval — so weak-signal sensitivity is
never reduced.
