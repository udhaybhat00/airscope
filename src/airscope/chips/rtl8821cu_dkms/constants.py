"""RTL8821CU (vendor rtl8821cu-5.12.0.4 / HALMAC) — register + protocol constants.

Cleanroom: every value here is pasted verbatim from the vendor source, cited
``[SRC] <file>:<line>`` against ``driver_captures/captures_rtl8821cu/driver-source/``.
Do NOT type a constant from memory — grep it out.

Scope so far: milestone 1 (USB transport + the HALMAC card-enable power sequence).
Later milestones (chip-id/EFUSE, firmware download, MAC/BB/RF init) append here.
