"""WEP key recovery from collected IVs.

``PtwCracker`` implements the ``WepCracker`` protocol: a native,
self-contained PTW (Pyshkin-Tews-Weinmann 2007) key-recovery. No external
aircrack. Fed a stream of ``(IV, keystream)`` samples; the per-IV votes are
*additive*, so it ingests incrementally as IVs arrive and a cheap search
re-runs on demand.

Pure Python, needs no hardware: correctness is proven offline by
``tests/crack/test_wep_crack.py``, which generates WEP packets under a known
key and asserts recovery.

PTW background (why it works): a WEP per-packet RC4 key is ``IV(3) || root``.
The IV is public, so the first 3 KSA steps are known. Klein's correlation
then lets each packet's early keystream bytes *vote* for the root-key byte
sums; with enough IVs the correct sums win by a wide margin. Because the
first ~16 plaintext bytes of an ARP are fixed (LLC/SNAP + ARP header), ARP
traffic yields the known keystream PTW needs, which is exactly what ARP
replay floods us with.
