"""Acceptance gate: replay-diff the rtl8188eus (RTL8188EUS, TL-WN722N v2/v3) bring-up
against its cold-boot capture.

The 8188e is rtl8xxxu, not rtw88, but the USB register wire format is identical (Realtek
vendor 0x05, address in wValue), so it reuses the shared Realtek replay engine.

This capture set is the **mainline rtl8xxxu** cold boot (``airmon-ng.log``: driver rtl8xxxu) --
the driver this port mirrors -- so the register *sequence* replays byte-for-byte, not just the
blob. (The DKMS/vendor ``realtek-rtl8188eus`` boot in ``driver_captures/captures_8188eu/`` is the
target of a separate vendor port.) Coverage grows milestone-by-milestone as the port is walked
against the kernel source:

* **FW blob** -- the rtl8188eufw.bin payload as it lands on REG_FW_START_ADDRESS (0x1000), in
  196-byte chunks, concatenated == the bundled blob.
* **MAC + PHY** -- ``init_mac`` (MAC table + MAX_AGGR) then ``post_mac_init_phy``
  (BB + AGC tables + ``set_crystal_cap`` + RF path A), anchored at the MAC table's first write
  (0x0026), driven against the recorded chip reads so every emitted write must match the wire.

Not yet gated (driver still diverges from the wire here): the EFUSE *read* (crystal_cap is
sourced from the capture's own REG_AFE_XTAL_CTRL write below), the pre-FW power-on /
queue-init order, and the post-PHY block (RFSW control, TX-buffer/LLT, usb_quirks, RCR,
adaptive controls, IQK/LCK). Those land as the bring-up is restructured to mirror init_device.
