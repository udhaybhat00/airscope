"""Acceptance gate: replay-diff the rtl8187 (RTL8187L, ALFA AWUS036H) bring-up against
its cold-boot capture.

ONE monotonic walk, ONE cursor, fail-closed. Unlike the rtw88 ``ReplayTransport`` (which
reimplements read8/write8/...), this gate replays at the ``ctrl_transfer`` layer
(``rtw88_pcap_replay.ReplayDevice``) so the REAL ``chips/rtl8187`` transport drives it --
including the rtl8225 RF SPI **8051 fast path** (``t.dev.ctrl_transfer`` wValue=RF-addr,
wIndex=0x8225), which a reimplemented transport could not reach. Every helper -- register
read/write, the EEPROM_CMD 93cx6 bit-bang, the RF bit-bang reads, the 8051 write -- replays
with zero reimplementation.

Each op the card emitted has exactly one honest fate as the cursor advances:
  * matched     -- the port's real handler reproduces it byte-for-byte.
  * waived      -- an explicit, named, counted boundary for a non-vendor-driver producer.
  * unaccounted -- anything else STOPS the walk and names the op: the porting frontier.

The walk is: probe (93cx6 EEPROM + asic_rev + HWVER + detect_rf + rfkill init) -> init_hw +
the full rtl8225z2 RF init -> start -> configure_filter (monitor entry) -> every airodump /
iw channel hop (rtl8187_config), with the periodic rfkill GPIO poll and the per-hop
monitor-filter reapply dispatched as async producers. The aireplay-ng deauth at the tail is
bulk-OUT (a different program's TX) -- out of this control-stream gate, byte-diffed separately.
