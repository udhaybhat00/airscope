# Configure the mt76 USB stack to DISABLE scatter-gather, so usbmon can actually
# capture the device->host (RX) data — beacons, MCU responses, the firmware-up
# signal. Without this, mt76's RX URBs use scatter-gather buffers and usbmon only
# snapshots urb->transfer_buffer (NULL for SG), so every inbound transfer is
# captured as a header with zero data. See chips/mt7921au/MT7921AU.md ("blind spot").
#
# IMPORTANT: this does NOT fix the FW_START / -110 boot wedge. Confirmed on the
# sibling mt7925u (vendor/USB-WiFi#688): disabling SG "changed nothing" on boot.
# It ONLY makes the RX visible for verify_pcap / beacon analysis.
#
# The knob lives on the SHARED mt76_usb module (mt76-usb-y := usb.o), not mt7921u,
# so it affects EVERY mt76 USB adapter until you remove the conf (--remove).
