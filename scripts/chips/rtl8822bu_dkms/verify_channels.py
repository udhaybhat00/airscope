"""Byte-for-byte differ for the per-channel RF retune (the airodump hop).

verify_pcap.py covers the cold init; the cold-boot captures ALSO contain the vendor driver's
tune for every channel an airodump `--band abg` sweep hopped (`<cap>_logs/iw.log`: 2.4 GHz 1-12,
5 GHz 36..165, back to 1). Each `iw set channel N` is one config_phydm_switch_channel_8822b +
spur reset (+ a band switch on a 2.4<->5 crossing, + the bandwidth re-apply — both still WIP).

Slices each `iw set channel N` window (iw.log epoch -> pcap frame) and replays chan.switch_channel
against it from the window's FIRST op (no anchoring). switch_channel reproduces the retune prologue
of each window; the trailing ops (mac_switch_bandwidth + switch_bandwidth, and on crossings the
band switch) are the not-yet-ported remainder, so we report the matched-op count and the first
unmatched op rather than demanding the whole window. A divergence inside the matched span is a
real port bug. Windows whose head isn't switch_channel's RF-0x18 read (band-switch crossings,
slicing artifacts) are flagged separately.
