"""Live-vs-capture state diff over the BB AGC / CCK register block.

`verify_pcap` proves our init *writes* match the capture, but it feeds recorded reads —
so a read-modify-write that lands on a wrong value on LIVE silicon is invisible to it.
This walks every BB register in the AGC/CCK range that the capture's kernel wrote during
bring-up, reads the SAME register off our live chip after our bring-up, and reports any
divergence. A mismatch in the CCK/AGC block is a prime suspect for the CCK RX deficit
(the reference AP beacons 100% CCK and is under-heard).
