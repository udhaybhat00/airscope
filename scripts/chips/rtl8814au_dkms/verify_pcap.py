"""Acceptance gate: ONE monotonic single-cursor walk of the rtl8814au_dkms cold-boot capture.

Fail-closed, never short-circuited. One cursor runs from the driver's first vendor op
(the probe chip-version read) to the end of the capture; every op has exactly one honest
fate as the cursor advances:

  * matched       — the port's real handler reproduces it byte-for-byte at the cursor.
  * unaccounted   — anything else STOPS the walk and names the op: the porting frontier,
                    the next op to reproduce. PASS <=> zero unaccounted.

There is **no legitimate waiver** — every op reproduce-or-fail to the last frame: the whole
control conversation (init + airmon STA->monitor dance + airodump hops + the phydm
dynamic-check watchdog) AND the aireplay-ng bulk-OUT injections. Two capture sets are wired:
``captures_rtl8814au`` (2.4 GHz aireplay, the default) and ``captures_rtl8814au_2`` (5 GHz injection,
select with a ``new2/`` prefix). Both PASS 100% byte-for-byte.

We do not run airmon/airodump/iw against our port; the chip only sees register writes, so
the vendor-driver writes those tools trigger are ours to reproduce. airscope is the trigger:
the bring-up + airmon dance is the deterministic init walk; the operational phase dispatches
each burst to the real handler at the cursor — a channel hop (set_channel_bw), a dynamic-check
tick (the sreset poll + phydm watchdog), or a frame injection (update_txdesc + bulk-OUT) —
distinguished by a unique opener. The LED blink and injection run on their own timers, so they
splice into a mid-flight handler; ``_drain_async`` drains each at the cursor.
