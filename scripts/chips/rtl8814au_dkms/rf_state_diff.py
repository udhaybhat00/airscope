"""Live-vs-capture state diff over the RF (radio) registers — the last RX-relevant seam.

The BB/MAC state diff (cck_state_diff.py) covers MMIO registers. RF registers are written
via the per-path LSSI window (0xc90/0xe90/0x1890/0x1a90, value = (rf_addr<<20)|data) and read
back via the MMIO readback window (rf._rf_read). verify_pcap proves our RF *writes* match the
capture, but an RMW that reads a different live RF value (e.g. _copy_rck1, the channel/bw RMW)
is invisible to it. This walks every RF register the capture wrote per path, reads it back off
live silicon after our bring-up, and diffs — a divergent RF gain/LNA/cal register is RX-critical.
