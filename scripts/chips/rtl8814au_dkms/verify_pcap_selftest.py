"""Does verify_pcap actually CATCH divergences? — an adversarial self-test of the gate.

A gate that PASSES a correct port is worthless if it also passes a BROKEN one. This mutates the
real driver's output one op-class at a time (corrupt a computed value / inject an extra write),
re-runs verify_pcap against the SAME capture, and asserts the gate flips to FAIL. A mutation the
gate still PASSES is a blind spot — a class of real divergence the gate cannot see.

Each mutation is a monkeypatch of a driver write-emitter, applied only for that one run and then
restored; the driver source on disk is never changed. The call-counter distinguishes a genuine
blind spot (emitter ran, gate still PASSED) from "not exercised in this capture" (emitter never
ran — inconclusive, try another capture).
