"""HARDWARE validation of the _hw_lock fix: hammer the card with the exact race that
wedged it (two concurrent channel tunes — the post-cancellation two-thread state) and
confirm RX survives + WPDMA stays armed.

Calling driver._tune() from two threads directly recreates what a UI view-switch produces:
a cancelled tune's executor thread still draining while a new tune's thread starts. With
the threading.Lock fix they serialize; without it they'd collide and wedge RX-DMA.
