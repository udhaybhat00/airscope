"""stop_hopping() must drain an in-flight channel tune before returning.

Reproduces the cross-family "bad Focus" bug (airscope.log @ 03:49:53): a channel-hop
set_channel offloads to a run_in_executor thread that cancellation can't stop. When Focus
entry cancels the hop loop mid-tune, the orphaned tune keeps running and finishes *after*
stop_hopping returns, moving the chip onto a stale hop channel right as Focus pins its
target, so Focus shows 0 beacons. The fix shields the tune as a task and has stop_hopping
await it, so the chip is on a known channel (and current_channel is truthful) before the
caller's next set_channel runs.
