"""RTL8822CU per hop TX AGC flush, driven by the computed TX power index. No hardware.

``_set_tx_power`` is the only consumer of the TX power port, so this is where the computation meets
the wire. The recorded reference indices and diff dwords in ``recorded_txagc`` came off a pcap of
the vendor driver; the values here come from that adapter's EFUSE PG bytes through the ported C.
