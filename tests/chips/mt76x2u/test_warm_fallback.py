"""Cold-reset fallback when warm-path `mcu_load_cr` times out.

Symptom we're guarding against: ~1-in-10 warm boots, the chip's MCU is
wedged from the previous session — drain didn't help (no stale data
either). The fix is to detect the timeout and force a full cold init
+ FW reload, then retry `mcu_load_cr` once.

These tests exercise the _structure_ of the fallback by mocking the
heavy machinery and asserting on call ordering / retry behavior.
