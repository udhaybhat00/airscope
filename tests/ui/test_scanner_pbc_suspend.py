"""Regression: the Scanner must not run its WPS PBC auto-invade while it's
suspended under another screen (Focus).

Textual's Screen.is_current is True for background screens too, so a suspended
Scanner reads is_current == True: the original guard never bailed and the Scanner
raced Focus's own PBC capture over the single radio (assoc rejected + EAPOL
timeout). The foreground gate must use screen-stack identity (app.screen is self).
